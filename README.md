# Punctuation Restoration with Fine-Tuned SlovakBERT

This project provides a Python-based implementation for fine-tuning a pre-trained SlovakBERT model to restore punctuation in text. It utilizes the Hugging Face `transformers` library and PyTorch for natural language processing tasks such as tokenization, model training, and prediction.

## Library Setup

This script uses several Python libraries for its functionality:

- `transformers`: for handling pre-trained models and tokenizers.
- `torch`: for deep learning tasks and model fine-tuning.
- `nltk`: for tokenization and text preprocessing.

To install the required libraries, use the following command:

```bash
